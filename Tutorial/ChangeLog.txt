get_relations.py
1. Don't output my relations with others in file 'relations.txt',so the node of 'me' is not displayed in graphs. This method reduces the file size, as opposed to the '--include_me' option provided in the original version.

bot.py
1. Don't output the string of 'https://www.instagram.com/' in 'relations.txt', which is seen as redundancies.
2. Correct 'classname' for being able to locate the right elements in web page HTML prabably because of the change of programs on the Instagram server side. Because the code was 2 years old and the Instagram webpages change all times, some code are likely to be unable to work now. (Competing with anti-scraping techniques is a challenging to all network scrape tools.)
3. Modify sleep time and add codes for properly retryinig or suspending, once Instagram blocks requests.
